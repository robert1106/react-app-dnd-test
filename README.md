# Creating a recursively nested accordion component (test work).

The project is made on the React framework.
At the top there are buttons that change with a drag drop, and depending on their position, the nesting order of the accordions changes. This ![link](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/CJRoman/53790acd766cd2820da6bbf884235cec/raw/5e392796d26c956c2585c1a29a1d4ead1487fb63/items.json) loads data, in which there are 1000 elements with five attributes, which are actually expressed by these buttons, and accordions group these elements by the required attribute, depending on the position of the buttons.
